# JS-Promise

### this is a project of the promise in JavaScript

Most of Node.js functions return the _Promise_ , because we usually use the asynchronous functions.
There's a function that returns a Promise itself such as
```js
fetch()
```

but we also can create it.

To create, we can use the code below
```js
function func(){
  return new Promise();
}
```
